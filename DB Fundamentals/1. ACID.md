# Transaction

 - A set of queries/operation performing a particular task
 - Eg: Sending $10 from account A to B
 - One unit of work that cannot be broken into smaller parts
 - Either all operations of a Txn are completed successfully : in the case of success
 - Or none of them succeed : in the case of failure

## ACID Property

A - Atomicity  
C - Consistency  
I - Isolation  
D - Durability  


### Atomicity

 - The property that ensures a Txn completes successfully or doesn't execute at all
 - i.e, it treats a txn as 1 unit
 - If an operation fails during a txn, all previous successful operations have to ***rollback***

### Isolation

##### Read Phenomena

1. Dirty Read
   - the queries of a txn is able to see all changes (committed or not) of another txn
   - extremely undesirable
2. Non-Repeatable Read
    - the query results of 2 same reads within a txn yields 2 different results
    - caused due to the read of committed changes of other txn (update of the data within the query range)
3. Phantom Read
   - read of records that didnt exist in the initial read
   - leads to inconsistency of data
   - caused by insert or update by the commit of another txn - especially of the records that fall in the range of the txn's query 
4. Lost Updates
   - Initial update of a txn is overridden by another txn's committed changes
   - leading to inconsistency of data

##### Isolation Levels {#isolation-levels}

Ways to handle read phenomenas

1. Read uncommitted
   - any change outside the txn is visible to the query (committed or not)
   - no form of isolation
   - very undesirable
2. Read committed
   - only committed changes are visible to the queries of a txn
   - this is bad as well
3. Repeatable Reads
   - the <u> initial read of a row or table </u> will remain unchanged while txn executes
   - if there are no reads in a txn, then it cannot be handled
   - an isolation level to handle non-repeatable reads
   - does not address phantom read
   - psql treats repeatable reads as a snapshot - everything is versioned
4. Snapshot
   - each query sees an <u> instance of the db with data committed up to the start of the txn </u>
   - addresses all read phenomenas
   - expensive
5. Serialization
   - no concurrency
   - txn takes place one after the other

### Consistency

Ability to read proper data

##### Consistency in Data

Factors that lead to inconsistency in data that was read:  
(Initially Row 1 Column 1 data was 100. but in next read it is 50 while the same txn is running)
- improper referential integrity
  - Eg: Deleting a product from PRODUCT table but failing to remove its availability in child table
- no atomicity
  - atomicity ensures consistency of data
  - failure of txn after update and not performing rollback causes inconsistency
  - Eg: $100 transfer fails after deduction from Account A, without rollback, money is lost in thin air.
- Isolation
  - depending on isolation level incorporated by the txn, it can lead to inconsistency in data
  - refer [ isolation levels ](#isolation-levels)

##### Consistency in reads

- inconsistency in read affects the whole system
- eventual consistency will ensure that the read is corrected eventually in later reads.
  - enforced in synchronous replication

### Durability
